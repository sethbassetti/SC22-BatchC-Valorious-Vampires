of renewable energy, and taking measures to reduce energy use.', 'electricity will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.', 'carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.', 'while communities may adapt to climate change through efforts like better coastline protection, they cannot avert the risk of severe, widespread, and permanent impacts.', 'before the s, it was unclear whether warming by increased greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced cooling.', 'scientists then often used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to the human impact on the climate.', 'in the s, the terms global warming and

popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his testimony in the u.s. senate.', 'in the s, the term climate change increased in popularity.', 'global warming usually refers to human-induced warming of the earth system, whereas climate change can refer to natural or anthropogenic change.', 'the two terms are often used interchangeably.', 'various scientists, politicians and

days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.', 'there was little net warming between the th century and the mid- th century.', 'climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.', 'thermometer records began to provide global coverage around .', 'historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the medieval climate anomaly and the little ice age, did not occur at the same time across different regions.', 'temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late- th century in a limited set of regions.', 'there have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the paleocene–eocene thermal maximum.', \"however, the modern observed rise in temperature and co concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in earth's history do not approach current rates.\", 'evidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations.', 'there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity.', 'flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring.', \"another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space.\", 'regions of the world warm at differing rates.', 'the pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet.', 'since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature.', 'this is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.', 'the thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least , and over % of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.', 'the rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.', 'the northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere.', 'the northern hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow

include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the earth's orbit around the sun.\", 'to determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out.', 'a key approach is to determine unique \"fingerprints\" for all potential causes, then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change.', 'for example, solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause.', 'its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere.', 'yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing.', 'attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.', \"greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the earth's surface.\", 'the earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it.', \"this absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the earth's surface and warming it over time.\", 'before the industrial revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about °c warmer than it would have been in their absence.', 'while water vapour (~ %) and clouds (~ %) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks.', 'on the other hand, concentrations of gases such as co (~ %), tropospheric ozone, cfcs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcings.', 'human activity since the industrial revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance.', 'in , the concentrations of co and methane had increased by about % and %, respectively, since .', 'these co levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last million years.', 'concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last , years.', 'global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in were equivalent to billion tonnes of co . of these emissions, % was co , % was methane, % was nitrous oxide, and % was fluorinated gases.', 'co emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity.', 'additional co emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the co released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser.', 'methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction.', 'nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser.', \"despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for co . land-surface sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about % of annual global co emissions.\", 'the ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process.', 'first, co dissolves in the surface water.', \"afterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle.\", \"over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed to % of emitted co . air pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the climate on a large scale.\", \"from to , a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming, typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.\", 'globally, aerosols have been declining since , meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.', 'aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation.', \"they also have indirect effects on the earth's radiation budget.\", 'sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets.', 'these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.', 'they also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.', 'indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.', 'while aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming.', 'not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise.', 'limiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by .', '°c by .', \"humans change the earth's surface mainly to create more agricultural land.\", \"today, agriculture takes up % of earth's land area, while % is forests, and % is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.).\", 'the amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming.', 'deforestation releases co contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more co in the future.', 'the main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil ( %), logging to produce forestry/forest products ( %), short term shifting cultivation ( %), and wildfires ( %).', 'land use changes not only affect greenhouse gas emissions.', 'the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature.', 'it impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation.', 'for instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight.', 'deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns.', 'in tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect.', 'globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.', 'physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity.', \"as the sun is the earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system.\", 'solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, and indirect measurements are available from the early s onwards.', \"there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun's energy reaching the earth.\", 'further evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere).', 'if solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm.', 'explosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era.', 'when the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years.', 'the temperature signal lasts about twice as long.', 'in the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends.', 'present-day volcanic co emissions are equivalent to less than % of current anthropogenic co emissions.', 'the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by self-reinforcing feedbacks and reduced by balancing feedbacks.', 'the main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds.', \"the primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature.\", 'in addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of co on plant growth.', 'uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.', 'as the air is warmed by greenhouse gases, it can hold more moisture.', 'water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas, so this further heats the atmosphere.', 'if cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet.', 'if clouds become higher and thinner, they act as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet.', 'the effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty.', \"another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the earth's surface.\", \"more of the sun's energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to amplification of arctic temperature changes.\", 'arctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and co into the atmosphere.', 'climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems.', 'overall, climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive.', 'around half of human-caused co emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans.', 'on land, elevated co and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth.', 'climate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow in the future.', 'soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up.', 'as more co and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon.', 'overall, at higher co concentrations the earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions.', 'a climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system.', 'models are used to calculate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks.', \"models also include natural processes like changes in the earth's orbit, historical changes in the sun's activity, and volcanic forcing.\", 'in addition to estimating future temperatures, they reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.', 'the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.', 'past models have underestimated the rate of arctic shrinkage and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase.', 'sea level rise since was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations.', 'the united states-published national climate assessment notes that \"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\".', 'a subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model.', 'these models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect – and interact with – the physical climate.', 'with this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions.', 'this is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future.', 'depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric co concentrations that range widely between and ppm.', 'the ipcc sixth assessment report projects that global warming is very likely to reach .', '°c to .', '°c by the late st century under the very low ghg emissions scenario.', 'in an intermediate
